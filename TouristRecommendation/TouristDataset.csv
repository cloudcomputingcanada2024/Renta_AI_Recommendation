The house is just like it is seen in the images and described. Personally, I liked the soothing surroundings, beautiful lawn, and the F10 central market which is accessible with in 5 min drive. The small park at the door step makes this house top-notch.  I was working from home and the internet connection and the speed was also fascinating. House has its own parking space and separate entrance. Security, vibes, calmness, and amenities makes it perfect place and it gives at home feel. Highly recommended",Low

The appartment is beautiful and modern with an awesome view over Islamabad. For the price you CANT get any better AirBNB and believe me i tried alot in that pricerangeThe mainpoint is you feel so comfy. Modern, clean and comfy furnitures. Clean to a 5 star Hotel standard. Best view you can get by far and just imagine waking up with Islamabad in the early hours infront of you...it was one of the best moments i had in Islamabad.
To rank my judgment. Im born and raised in Germany and worked as an int. Manager so saw alot of airbnbs and 5 star hotels. For the price here you get so much more then anywhere else.
Worth every dime. Just book enjoy the moment from the booking and contact to the host, the waking up with the best view to a comfy place you can call home after minutes!",Low

It is quite elevated from the lake getting privacy from the neighbourhood and giving a beautiful vista of khanpur lake and it's surroundings. 
The villa is very nicely organised with a neutral color scheme which adds to its peaceful character surrounded by its maintained lawns. It has cupboards to store your clothes and some basic necessities and accessories like shampoo, facial cream, mosquito repellent, cotton buds, toothbrush, bed covers, linen, quilt covers,etc. Which we took the advantage to change the quilt cover which wasn't giving a fresh feel even though it looked clean. Spacious and functional bathroom with rain shower but unfortunately the water heater wasn't working properly during our visit. Compact but well equipped and very functional kitchen was a real treat to store cooked food in the fridge or to cook or warm up the food, however the kitchen had a weird smell even though everything looked clean.  Small and a very basic swimming pool with out skimmers & heating system situated on an upper terrace gives a nice hangout place during the day with privacy. 
The helping staff was very welcoming, caring and accommodating who took care of our needs quite diligently. Whether it was setting up the kayaks or providing the life jackets or getting tea or breakfast the staff was always connected via walkie talkie.
The only catch is that it's not for more than 3 persons and one cannot spend the night there in a group of 5 to 7 people. The price is a bit on the higher side however there are very few options like this on Airbnb.",Low

The villa is very nicely organised with a neutral color scheme which adds to its peaceful character surrounded by its maintained lawns. It has cupboards to store your clothes and some basic necessities and accessories like shampoo, facial cream, mosquito repellent, cotton buds, toothbrush, bed covers, linen, quilt covers,etc. Which we took the advantage to change the quilt cover which wasn't giving a fresh feel even though it looked clean. Spacious and functional bathroom with rain shower but unfortunately the water heater wasn't working properly during our visit. Compact but well equipped and very functional kitchen was a real treat to store cooked food in the fridge or to cook or warm up the food, however the kitchen had a weird smell even though everything looked clean.  Small and a very basic swimming pool with out skimmers & heating system situated on an upper terrace gives a nice hangout place during the day with privacy. 
The helping staff was very welcoming, caring and accommodating who took care of our needs quite diligently. Whether it was setting up the kayaks or providing the life jackets or getting tea or breakfast the staff was always connected via walkie talkie.
The only catch is that it's not for more than 3 persons and one cannot spend the night there in a group of 5 to 7 people. The price is a bit on the higher side however there are very few options like this on Airbnb.",Low

Check in was smooth, everything from the bathroom accessories to the bedding and kitchen gadgets was of the highest quality. The house staff was super efficient but stayed out of our way unless asked to come (on a very cool walkie talkie) following which they'd appear in a matter of moments! We took some meats with us and asked the staff to arrange a grill and bonfire for the night which was one of the highlights. The firewood was ample, the fire pits were huuuge. Inside the room there's a cool fire stove installed but we chose to go with the inverter AC which made the room toasty in 10 minutes. Hot water, generator, perfectly working modern kitchen. Everything also felt very safe and secure. There's a couple of small pools that would be nice for a dip in the summer, and a flat roof area overlooking the lake where we had our bonfire. The property comprises of a single room, a roomy bathroom with a huge shower area, and a kitchen. The entire place feels really very modern but also really cosy and warm at the same time. The furniture is so tasteful and every window looks out at something wonderful-- there's even a bedside projector for a chilly night in. I'm picky about the bedding, bath mats and towels, and was happy to see all were great quality. You have to bring your own groceries to cook of course, because there isn't a place close by to get them-- which is part of the charm. But there is a greenhouse on the property from where we picked some fresh organic basil for our lunch pasta. We had planned to take the kayaks out but it rained the morning of our stay and we decided to cook and just chill instead. This property works best for: a couple, a couple with a child, or 3 adults who are comfortable sleeping in the same room (in that order).

There’s also a roof-top patio with exercise equipment that you can use at your convenience, as well as a lawn with sitting area.
The host provides free filtered water, which is a great convenience. There’s a sweeper who comes every couple of days to clean the place, and the caretaker can take your clothes to the  laundry service for a very nominal charge.

1) Smart TV device is little tricky to operate. So, it can be upgraded.

The most beautiful Fatima Jinnah Park is right across the road. All restaurants and shopping area in F-10 markaz is at walking distance. 
The place of Asfand is very safe and secure. It has huge car parking where your car is completely safe. 
If I have to choose this place for next time, I will not shy to do so.
Suggestions for improvements:
1) Smart TV device is little tricky to operate. So, it can be upgraded.
2) The old ACs may be replaced with new DC inverters.

He always responded extremely quickly and nothing was too much. At one point, the remote control batteries died and he had someone come round with new batteries within the hour even though it was quite late at night!
Positives:
- The room itself is decent with most of your needs, however you will struggle if you intend to extensively cook as there is no oven, along with no facilities to wash your clothing. Bed is nice and big and comfortable, TV has everything you need (netflix etc) and the internet is decent. Battery backup ensure power remains on for the lights/tv/internet. 
- Location - it is in a fairly central location, you can easily get an Uber/ride to the main parts of the city and there are lots of shops/places to eat only a 5m walk away from the property. Security is also present, I only had 1 issue with them which is when I forgot to bring a long my passport. So if you do stay here, make sure to keep a form of ID on you at all times. There is plenty of room for parking.
I had to struggle for the negatives, and some of these may seem like nitpicking but I thought are still worth mentioning. 
- The room has AC which is great at keeping the room cool. However due to frequent power cuts in the city, you will sometimes be unable to use it. If you are particularly sensitive to heat this will be an issue for you. There is a battery backup but it is only for the lights, internet at TV - for some reason the fridge is not connected to the battery backup. Finally - there are a few small cockroaches that inhabit the kitchen - this may be beyond the hosts control, because everywhere I have stayed in Pakistan with multiple rooms has had cockroaches. For example, I have stayed in more 'fancier' places such as the Centaurus apartments and that place was infested with giant cockroaches, all in the bathroom and kitchen. 
- Location - The building itself/area is considered a 'party place'. Many nights loud techno music was booming from other neighbouring rooms, thankfully I had ear plugs so this was not a problem. This could be a positive if you are into this sort of stuff. Furthermore, the building itself is not technically part of Greenwood Apartments, its a smaller building on the same complex - the room itself is right at the bottom so there is hardly any view outside the window. The actual greenwood apartments completely collapsed during the last major earthquake, I'd imagine it would probably reoccur with this building.",medium

2) Washroom smelled bad and wasn't properly cleaned. Door couldn't be closed
3) Plenty of bugs were around.
4) Upon check-in host&friends  were leaving the place. Apartment had unpleasant smoky smell.
5) As room window was opened because of  portable AC exhaust we could hear traffic noise.

The owner first told me that the place I booked wasn’t available. Then after pushing he told me there’s a sink issue so he gave me this other place. The place he gave me had a disgusting cigarette smell everywhere from the lounge area, to the bedroom to the bathroom. I complained and he told me to open windows. Which I did. But my concern is, what is the service/cleaning fee for then? And why am I being forced another place?
Also the place I booked was expensive and this place given was listed cheaper. So I got hustled here too. 
Its not my job to clean the place, its not my job to convince myself for a different place. I should get what I paid for.
Unfortunately this was a very bad experience.
I left after hardly 4-6 hours of checking in because it was unacceptable.",Low

The owner first told me that the place I booked wasn’t available. Then after pushing he told me there’s a sink issue so he gave me this other place. The place he gave me had a disgusting cigarette smell everywhere from the lounge area, to the bedroom to the bathroom. I complained and he told me to open windows. Which I did. But my concern is, what is the service/cleaning fee for then? And why am I being forced another place?
Also the place I booked was expensive and this place given was listed cheaper. So I got hustled here too. 
Its not my job to clean the place, its not my job to convince myself for a different place. I should get what I paid for.
Unfortunately this was a very bad experience.

What a fabulous apartment with all the facilities you would need for a short stay. It was really nice and peaceful too.
My stay was between 17th October - 20th October.
The apartment had a large en suite bedroom with a double bed and a single mattress. There was a lounge and an open plan kitchen. 
The balcony had enough room to seat a couple of chairs to admire the amazing view from the 12th floor. 
The host/ agent made sure we had everything we needed and were really welcoming with any queries or questions. 
The internet connection was fab. The TV was connected to YouTube and Netflix so you're spoilt for choice what to watch. 
The only thing I would say is the apartment complex is still under construction, so there were some minor things that needed looking at... i.e the tap at the sink was a little loose but that didn't affect the function overall. 
I will definitely be looking you up on my next trip. I might even book you for a few days before heading off home to the UK.

Very good location for someone who has a car! Be mindful that the building is still under construction so there's a lot of noise and rubble in the corridors and the parking is muddy.
Pros:
Loc is great. Just in front of Centaurus and metro staion.
Apartment has great views.
Cons:
This aoartment comes at a premium price, so I was expecting atleast some water/tea bags/kettle to be there which wasn't. Water was however provided immediately after I communicated it to the host.
Cleanliness: The rug wasn't vaccumed, the balcony was dirty. 
Matress: The bed's matress was somewhat really hard for me. I knkw it's a matter of choice but I have stayed at quite some places and this was the hardest matress I have ever experienced so far. 
Note:I know my expectations are a bit higher than the usual in terms of cleanliness. But the apartment was overall in good condition and basic amenities were provided and the bed/toilet was in general v clean. So I'd recommend the property.

I think all Airbnb hosts need to be more honest by showing photos that give a true reflection of the state of repair and decor in the apartment being rented out.
I would be happy to share the photos sent to Waleed. They illustrate how different the apartment look and feel is compared to how the host has purposefully provided photos of the nicer element of the flat and not the ones that represent a true reflection.

1. Looks like the items in the kitchen were not washed for a long time, one of the pots was moldy and smelly. 
2. The apartment looked clean at glance but the floor was a bit dusty 
3. One of the washrooms had a drainage issue (not a big deal for us though, because we were a small family and we used the other washroom) 
4. The listing says there is a dryer and washer at the apartment but the washing machine was not properly installed and there were no tools for us install the pipe, or connect the washing machine with a socket because there was none in the washing area. 
The host was responsive though, when there was a hot water disconnection, he guided me to turn on the geyser. 
If the host addresses the issues mentioned above I think this apartment will be a good ""value to money"" stay in this part of Islamabad.",Low

Location: First of all, the location is completely the CBD, it is easy to go everywhere.There are various supermarkets and restaurants are convenient for living.
Safety: The apartment has a front desk with security guards at your doorstep, and the street outside is very safe for one person to walk alone at 12pm.There are many Chinese people in the neighborhood.
Price: The price is not much different from other high-end listings on airbnb, but the house has a lot of additional soft conditions such as the house with UPS, high-speed WiFi, Netflix members, the key is that as long as you feel that the room is missing, you can tell the host directly, he will basically buy it for you.
Facilities: All kinds of equipment are basically complete, no need to buy extra things, the hair dryer was broken when I first checked in, the host immediately brought one.

The place provided privacy with no interference from anyone. It was clean and well-kept. There were marts, pharmacy and food places near-by so had an amazing time there. 
BUT I will add that the kitchen was smaller than I expected. There weren’t any pans, tawa or big spoons to even make your own breakfast and no counter space at all. You can basically only make chai here (so keep that in your mind). Other than that, there was no functional lights around any mirror or in washroom, so no space to do your makeup.

- Massive attention to detail
- VERY clean
- Very helpful attendant
- Tastefull decorated
- All basic amenities provided (and some extras too!)
- Comfy bed, sufficient soundproofing of the windows
- Fast wifi
- Smack in front of the markaz so fantastic options available at walkable distance (from a full fledged mall, grocery stores to coffee shops)
Cons:
- Building outlook is quite dated and dirty
- Flat is in basement so you will get no to poor mobile reception
- Basement parking while safe is tricky to manoeuvre.
While these are downsides, I feel none of this is in the host's control, the factors that he can control i.e. inside the flat were all well taken care of hence the 5 stars. This is definitely value for money.",Low

- Massive attention to detail
- VERY clean
- Very helpful attendant
- Tastefull decorated
- All basic amenities provided (and some extras too!)
- Comfy bed, sufficient soundproofing of the windows
- Fast wifi
- Smack in front of the markaz so fantastic options available at walkable distance (from a full fledged mall, grocery stores to coffee shops)
Cons:
- Building outlook is quite dated and dirty
- Flat is in basement so you will get no to poor mobile reception
- Basement parking while safe is tricky to manoeuvre.
While these are downsides, I feel none of this is in the host's control, the factors that he can control i.e. inside the flat were all well taken care of hence the 5 stars. This is definitely value for money.",Low

We felt right at home the moment we walked in. It was absolutely sparkling clean. There was a lot of thought put into decor and every little detail. Linen were white and clean. Pillows were comfortable! Probably one of the cleanest washrooms I have seen in an Airbnb ever.

there are some place where corrective measures should be taken

2. they gave a blanket and mattress for the 3rd accommodationwhich was charged, the problem is the was  not washed/ clean. i reorted it and next day i was given a while quilt cover to cover the same blanket.

The host was informed before arriving about the arrival time and all but upon arrival he didn't respond. Upon waiting for one hour we called the guy he has hired to manage the check-ins and that guy refused to let us in because apparently the host didn't inform him about our stay. Even upon showing BnB Receipt and Screenshots of booking the guy just told us to wait for host to respond. we waited 3 hours before booking a new apartment. The host responded in the evening saying sorry it was mistake. Ruined our mood and whole day. 
PS. the building was really dirty and poorly mantained. The apartment is on SECOND FLOOR and Building has NO LIFT so families and people with luggage be cautious.",Low

Overall I would say it was quite a pleasant stay. 
Things I liked:
1) Communication was extremely prompt.
2) If something was missing, it was provided immediately.
3) Room was very well heated.
4) Hot water was instantly available for shower.
5) We required an additional blanket and found that easily so I was very happy with that.
6) Tea and coffee was available in the apartment.
Things I feel can be improved:
1) Found the location a bit hard to find. Maybe a small video showing a hyperlapse of someone walking from the entrance to the apartment, that would help a lot. This is just a suggestion.
2) Powdered milk was finished but our contact was quick to take care of that so I appreciate it.
3) I found the bedside tables to be dirty. The same was true for the cabinets underneath the Television set. I believe these areas need dusting.
4) The towel hanging handle in the bathroom was broken.
5) The faucet in the bathroom was hanging loosely.
6) The area around the exhaust fan was very dirty. I didn't want to be near it.
7) The shampoo and body wash seemed to be expired. 
8) I didn't find any towels.",Low

Overall I would say it was quite a pleasant stay. 
Things I liked:
1) Communication was extremely prompt.
2) If something was missing, it was provided immediately.
3) Room was very well heated.
4) Hot water was instantly available for shower.
5) We required an additional blanket and found that easily so I was very happy with that.
6) Tea and coffee was available in the apartment.
Things I feel can be improved:
1) Found the location a bit hard to find. Maybe a small video showing a hyperlapse of someone walking from the entrance to the apartment, that would help a lot. This is just a suggestion.
2) Powdered milk was finished but our contact was quick to take care of that so I appreciate it.
3) I found the bedside tables to be dirty. The same was true for the cabinets underneath the Television set. I believe these areas need dusting.
4) The towel hanging handle in the bathroom was broken.
5) The faucet in the bathroom was hanging loosely.
6) The area around the exhaust fan was very dirty. I didn't want to be near it.
7) The shampoo and body wash seemed to be expired. 
8) I didn't find any towels.",Low

There was a lack of hot water issue in cold Feb Islamabad but it was apparently due to the rain cutting the gas supply. There is a heater there but it is in Japanese which we didn't understand and had a hard time working. It is a private apartment but there was a guy who kept showing up unannounced with an excuse to come inside (once it was to pick up some blanket which obviously wasn't there but we let him in both times). Both time he told us that he was sent by the owner but owner never bothered to inform us that he was sending someone. It felt creepy and felt like a clear invasion of privacy. Our suggestion to owner is to be clear and transparent with future airbnb customers about such unannounced visits.

Not only was the view from the balcony as spectacular as the pictures (particularly the reason why I booked the place) but the rest of the home was just as advertised. 
The location itself is very safe, serene, and peaceful. A lot to do with a markaz that is walkable distance. Furthermore, brother Abdullah would periodically check in on us to make sure everything is up to par. As I’m running out of my allotted character limit, I’ll end by saying that this will be my go-to stay every time I visit, and my recommendation to all my family and friends.",Low

My review is genuine and an exact representation of what I thought of the stay.
From prior to booking until our last chat when checking out, brother Abdullah was nothing shy of a hospitable, accommodating, and overall very thoughtful host. Not only was the view from the balcony as spectacular as the pictures (particularly the reason why I booked the place) but the rest of the home was just as advertised. 
The location itself is very safe, serene, and peaceful. A lot to do with a markaz that is walkable distance. Furthermore, brother Abdullah would periodically check in on us to make sure everything is up to par. As I’m running out of my allotted character limit, I’ll end by saying that this will be my go-to stay every time I visit, and my recommendation to all my family and friends.",Low

To begin with the apartment was not clean. We had to contact Mr Abdullah to send the housekeeping staff for the purpose. The bedsheets were stained and the pillows were found in an extremely dilapidated condition. There were no amenities in the washroom, like towel, soap, shampoo etc. We had to request Mr Abdullah to send us the soap. Also there wasn't any potable drinking water available. We had to ask the host again for it. There was no  air-conditioning system in the lounge area. Lastly there was no gas in the kitchen area hence we could not prepare even the basic stuff like tea, which was very disappointing as we were paying a huge amount for a two nights stay in this apartment. 
These issues need to be addressed. I will not recommend this place to anyone for the reasons I mentioned and the price they are charging.",Low

The building is for party purposes only with loud noise blaring all night long. Could not get a moment’s sleep or peace. Place itself was infested with roaches and was unkempt. Kitchen hood was constantly on and could not be turned off. Had to personally call the electrician to turn it off. Wifi speed was pathetic. It’s surprising that Nabeel could not even install a proper wifi and just gave us a century’s old wifi device. 
Nabeel was unresponsive most of the time. He gave the wrong lock code and wifi password and after constantly messaging and calling him, he responded. He does not care one bit of the guest’s comfortability and peace. He was unbothered by our constant complaints of the loud noise all night long.
In the end all he did was refund 3k. I will be reporting his listing to Airbnb and get it removed so no one has to go through this terrible ordeal.",Low

Reminded him that AC is not working, he was not accepting at first but when he did i specifically told him to only fix it if he can manage it before i come back. to my surprise he was able to fix till midnight. imagine the apartment you booked is full with labours roaming around and violating your privacy and depriving you of the comfort you paid for💔 
I would suggest avoid booking something on Bahria heights, its full with party  boys and loud music all night.

The building is for party purposes only with loud noise blaring all night long. Could not get a moment’s sleep or peace. Place itself was infested with roaches and was unkempt. Kitchen hood was constantly on and could not be turned off. Had to personally call the electrician to turn it off. Wifi speed was pathetic. It’s surprising that Nabeel could not even install a proper wifi and just gave us a century’s old wifi device. 
Nabeel was unresponsive most of the time. He gave the wrong lock code and wifi password and after constantly messaging and calling him, he responded. He does not care one bit of the guest’s comfortability and peace. He was unbothered by our constant complaints of the loud noise all night long.
In the end all he did was refund 3k. I will be reporting his listing to Airbnb and get it removed so no one has to go through this terrible ordeal.",Low

Reminded him that AC is not working, he was not accepting at first but when he did i specifically told him to only fix it if he can manage it before i come back. to my surprise he was able to fix till midnight. imagine the apartment you booked is full with labours roaming around and violating your privacy and depriving you of the comfort you paid for💔 
I would suggest avoid booking something on Bahria heights, its full with party  boys and loud music all night.
He was kind enough to offer me free breakfast for my stay of three days to make it up for the horrible experience. imagine being offered free breakfast for living in a very unhygienic place 😅",Low

If you are a normal muslim family looking for a apartment to stay in, avoid this party of town. Get as far away as possible. These bahria heights high rise apartment blocks are not for families. They are for young single people trying to have fun. We were placed in one room, the all night long loud music, the unpleasant noises from the neighbouring apartments , the totally inept on-site security team all amounting to a torrid time. We were moved to another apartment on the same floor where we were given a personal guarantee from Nabeel there would be no disturbances. Literally the room opposite had to be repeatedly complained about as well as one down the way for constant party vibes being emitted. 
After security were heard yelling at some apartments, and then for those loud musics and parties to continue, we felt very unsafe. None of the residents seem to know the rules or care to follow them. Every night there would be loud music of some sort girls singing and laughing in one if the apartmebts around us. 
A bit about the apartment. The gas cooker was fine. The kitchen cupboards had not been cleaned ever. There were a good amount if glass jugs and cups to use that was good there were also plenty of plates bowls and cutlery available however there were only one saucepan to boil water in for my son. There was no kettle or toaster. There was a microwave. There was enough other furniture though. A nice dining table. A good amount of sofas and coffee tables. The balcony was clean but the door locks were broken so not safe for kids. The air conditioner in the living room was very temperamental. Even on 30 degrees heat in december the room would never warm up to feel cosy. The tv was a very old style sony bravia with no smart functions if its own. Nabeel had fitted a android box to it which was only goid for youtube as the netflix ui was just too hard to use. 
The bed in the bedroom was horrrible. It creaked like ut was a thousand years old. The matress was a single piece of foam and was not comfortable. Thr bedroom and en-suite had no heating at all. The ac unit only blew cold air. The single set of bed linen was appalling but apparently in pakistan they dont change bed linen on a regular basis. 
The bathroom was good but the lack of constant hot hot water was terrible. You will get hot water for only a minute of two then it will slowly cool all the way to full cold. Then you have to turn it off and wait a moment while the hot water tank fills amd heats again.",Low

This was my first time using AirBnB myself. Tons of things i had no idea about so there might be lacking on my end too.
The overall experience was good, the only thing that needs improvement is cleanup/cleanliness.
Other than that very responsive host. The hand shower went bonkers out of nowhere and on one call to the caretaker and a message to the host. It was replaced within an hour same night.
Good Internet, Netflix logged in and ready to use.
There was a market close by which the caretaker told me about but i couldn’t figure it out so i decided to go to the main market of the area which was a 5 min drive for necessities.
Summary: Highly recommended. I will definitely try to book this place again if i am visiting Islamabad.",Low

0) Very responsive host.
1) Location wasn't the best but not bad: a bit far from the center of Islamabad. G-13 isn't posh like some of the other blocks, but it does have a decent markaz. The house itself, which is towards the end of a residential street, is 2 mins walk from a market area with general store/tandoor/barber.
2) The house has a private car park (we had our own car).
3) The keeper of the house was always available (he stayed upstairs) .
4) Big-plus: The house was cosy in winter (late December). It is quite well-insulated. There was little need for heating. Both rooms had inverter A/C heater which we used for about an hour each. 
5) The kitchen was spacious and well-stocked.
6) Big TV with Netflix!

This was my first time using AirBnB myself. Tons of things i had no idea about so there might be lacking on my end too.
The overall experience was good, the only thing that needs improvement is cleanup/cleanliness.
Other than that very responsive host. The hand shower went bonkers out of nowhere and on one call to the caretaker and a message to the host. It was replaced within an hour same night.
Good Internet, Netflix logged in and ready to use.
There was a market close by which the caretaker told me about but i couldn’t figure it out so i decided to go to the main market of the area which was a 5 min drive for necessities.

0) Very responsive host.
1) Location wasn't the best but not bad: a bit far from the center of Islamabad. G-13 isn't posh like some of the other blocks, but it does have a decent markaz. The house itself, which is towards the end of a residential street, is 2 mins walk from a market area with general store/tandoor/barber.
2) The house has a private car park (we had our own car).
3) The keeper of the house was always available (he stayed upstairs) .
4) Big-plus: The house was cosy in winter (late December). It is quite well-insulated. There was little need for heating. Both rooms had inverter A/C heater which we used for about an hour each. 
5) The kitchen was spacious and well-stocked.
6) Big TV with Netflix!

It was a hassle free checkin, local care taker was extremely responsive and courteous.
Bedding, towels were clean. Quality toiletries ( shampoo, hand and body wash were provided)
Coming from abroad having such an experience is pakistan was really pleasing. 
I had an amazing experience, happy with the service, I’d recommend this place to anyone who has taste of nice ambience and interiors. I’ll try their other property next time. 
Note: there were small issues which owner Asad himself and his staff were ready to jump and fix and they did.
I’m very happy that my son born and raised abroad commented “ I can now feel Pakistan has some cool places to stay too”
Thats was my agenda :)",medium

I arrived late due to my travel arrangements but the team along with Abdul Qadeer were very accommodating and flexible during checking process. the home is beautifuland has everything a family needs. it's a stone throw away from f11 markaz which has great restaurantsand shops. my family loved our stay there and will definitely book again when we visit islamabad again. there is also a a nice little park for the kids to play right outside the apartment. Thanks to Assad and team for their hospitality. oh and having a tv with netflix/prime and other portals was fantastic bonus,medium

but the place itself is in the far area of islamabad within some small streets. Its a new building with nice elevator.
The place itself was clean but i recommend the host to atleast put water bottle in fridge.
There is no backup power so if electricity breaks down, you have to sit in dark.
The washroom was clean but there was no fresh towel ( but all airbnbs i have used in Islamabad so far have the same, old towel always )
I suggest the host to improve these small things and good luck in his business since I am sure he has good business mind and can grow.
for travelers who are foreigners, this place is totally not recommended. 
for inside country family or male frinds group, it is okay to stay since the streets look quite shady.",Low

but the place itself is in the far area of islamabad within some small streets. Its a new building with nice elevator.
The place itself was clean but i recommend the host to atleast put water bottle in fridge.
There is no backup power so if electricity breaks down, you have to sit in dark.
The washroom was clean but there was no fresh towel ( but all airbnbs i have used in Islamabad so far have the same, old towel always )
I suggest the host to improve these small things and good luck in his business since I am sure he has good business mind and can grow.
for travelers who are foreigners, this place is totally not recommended. 
for inside country family or male frinds group, it is okay to stay since the streets look quite shady.",Low

The host was understanding and assured me of my family's safety while staying at the apartment
Cons:
You don't often come across apartments/houses that are flawless, but I must confess that this property, the host, and the helpers were flawless—no cons at all. 
Once again, thank you for making our stay in Islamabad so enjoyable.",Low

There is central heating (+2 inventors, 1 in living area and other in bed room) - They truly makes a difference and will make your stay comfortable during winter season in Rawalpindi.

Heating was not present apart from A/C in one bedroom.
Pocket Wi-Fi goes up to 2.5mbps. Issue raised and we were told item can stream 3 devices, which is impossible. Asim will add high speed WiFi for a higher price, of course.
Cleanliness was okay. Overall noisy location with construction works happening day and night. Besides, location is too far from center of Islamabad or Rawalpindi, which can be a nuisance as public transportation is unreliable.

I checked out at 9.55 and returned the key on reception at 9.57am and informed him as well. he acknowledged it after 30 mins. 
after few days I replied to his msg and that ""preparing the apartment for guest in his job. not mine that I should have told him everything. I send him the pictures of the apartment and asked him to see and make his services better.""

He then stopped taking our calls so we had no choice left except to leave car outside far from building unprotected. Once we got into apartment, we had to deal with roaches in kitchen.

Arriving at Islamabad Airport is already at night, I don't know where I should stay, and I saw Irfan's house at the airport and booked it.
I was already surprised by the way to the house by taxi.The neighborhood of the house is very high quality and should be in the affluent neighborhood of Islamabad, which even reminds me of Irvine's Bay.
Upon arrival, Irfan lent me a local currency to pay the taxi driver and received me warmly.After learning that I didn't have dinner, Irfan drove me to a delicious local restaurant!Delicious food and a lively night in Islamabad!

Once we got there, we had an issue with parking space as building management won’t let you in unless you have a parking permit and host refused to help us as he was making fake promises to get us a permit in morning but he never did. He then stopped taking our calls so we had no choice left except to leave car outside far from building unprotected. Once we got into apartment, we had to deal with roaches in kitchen. In bedroom, sheets were smelly and dusty. There was dust on floor and on couches. Water pressure was extremely low and there are a-lot of maintenance issues broken things everywhere.

Upon arrival, Irfan lent me a local currency to pay the taxi driver and received me warmly.After learning that I didn't have dinner, Irfan drove me to a delicious local restaurant!Delicious food and a lively night in Islamabad!

This was my first time using AirBnB myself. Tons of things i had no idea about so there might be lacking on my end too.
The overall experience was good, the only thing that needs improvement is cleanup/cleanliness.
Other than that very responsive host. The hand shower went bonkers out of nowhere and on one call to the caretaker and a message to the host. It was replaced within an hour same night.
Good Internet, Netflix logged in and ready to use.
There was a market close by which the caretaker told me about but i couldn’t figure it out so i decided to go to the main market of the area which was a 5 min drive for necessities.
Summary: Highly recommended. I will definitely try to book this place again if i am visiting Islamabad.",Low

In chronological order of our stay:
0) Very responsive host.
1) Location wasn't the best but not bad: a bit far from the center of Islamabad. G-13 isn't posh like some of the other blocks, but it does have a decent markaz. The house itself, which is towards the end of a residential street, is 2 mins walk from a market area with general store/tandoor/barber.
2) The house has a private car park (we had our own car).
3) The keeper of the house was always available (he stayed upstairs) .
4) Big-plus: The house was cosy in winter (late December). It is quite well-insulated. There was little need for heating. Both rooms had inverter A/C heater which we used for about an hour each. 
5) The kitchen was spacious and well-stocked.
6) Big TV with Netflix! 
7) Bathrooms were OK: Clean + hot water available, but small and not attractive.
8) Big-plus: It felt like home. We slept really well.

This was my first time using AirBnB myself. Tons of things i had no idea about so there might be lacking on my end too.
The overall experience was good, the only thing that needs improvement is cleanup/cleanliness.
Other than that very responsive host. The hand shower went bonkers out of nowhere and on one call to the caretaker and a message to the host. It was replaced within an hour same night.
Good Internet, Netflix logged in and ready to use.
There was a market close by which the caretaker told me about but i couldn’t figure it out so i decided to go to the main market of the area which was a 5 min drive for necessities.
Summary: Highly recommended. I will definitely try to book this place again if i am visiting Islamabad.",Low

In chronological order of our stay:
0) Very responsive host.
1) Location wasn't the best but not bad: a bit far from the center of Islamabad. G-13 isn't posh like some of the other blocks, but it does have a decent markaz. The house itself, which is towards the end of a residential street, is 2 mins walk from a market area with general store/tandoor/barber.
2) The house has a private car park (we had our own car).
3) The keeper of the house was always available (he stayed upstairs) .
4) Big-plus: The house was cosy in winter (late December). It is quite well-insulated. There was little need for heating. Both rooms had inverter A/C heater which we used for about an hour each. 
5) The kitchen was spacious and well-stocked.
6) Big TV with Netflix! 
7) Bathrooms were OK: Clean + hot water available, but small and not attractive.
8) Big-plus: It felt like home. We slept really well.

Great location and great host. The apartment was very spacious. 
As you can see from the rating I enjoyed it overall. However two small issues were that the room wasn't as clean upon arrival and loadshedding caused inconvenience a few times (not the host's fault obviously). Even with the cleaning issue I expect Jawad will take care of and it shouldn't be a concern for future visits.
But again overall this was a great experience. These small issues don't put a dent in the stay overall.
Would I book again? That's an easy yes.",medium

1) The apartment was dusty & hygiene levels were not up to the mark & we had to do a proper cleaning before settling in. 
2) Several amenities check marked in the description were actually not there like extra towels, extra linens. No shampoo, no hand wash, no dishwashing liquid, no detergent. 
3) Missing cutlery & cleaning supplies. 
4) Profile mentioned that there's a crib at the apartment but it was not there. 
5) We informed the host about all these things, though he was responsive & he visited as well & committed to fill in all missing things but that never happened. 
6) Place is very central and safe with a spacious parking. Security was very proper and tight.

We had an awful experience. We booked two nights, one of which we were not going to stay in the BnB anyways, only booked to get an early check in for the next day. 
Host gave us a room on the 9th floor before we were supposed to check in. When we arrived, to my surprise, host deleted the messages on whats app and changed the room last minute. Claimed that the other room had a leak, that’s fine but at least communicate. Don’t be sneaky about it. 
When we got in to the room, after our 3 hr drive, we just wanted a place to shower and relax. No hot water. The host wants you to call reception to turn on the hot water when you arrive, I specially requested through Whats ap to have the hot water turned on for the second night of our stay since we were not going to be there first night. 
My wife got an asthma attack the only night we stayed there because of the dust on the fans. Couches were stained, fridge was filthy…. This place was definitely not cleaned in weeks.",Low

Water was already served in room.
Cons: 
1) Door closes at 11pm, 
Although its mentioned in instructions but for a person like me who has business male fellows (freelancers) coming twice or thrice to Islamabad in a month we like to stay out late night, like cruising around city, listening ghazal in Marriott till 1am which starts at 11pm etc.
I think 11 pm is way too early we like to come in and out hustle free. So yesterday we came at 2am and called house keeper he revised instructions to me and got the door opened.
2) The lavish furnished bethak shown in pictures was closed to visit , although I didn’t ask for them to open it I’m un sure they may have opened it if asked.
Anyhow its value you the money, but 11pm is a big turn off for me and fellows, if that was not there we would love to hire again and again.

I had originally booked an apartment for 2 days but needed to stay another night. The apartment I was in had already been booked for the next set of guests so I had to move to another apartment in the block next door. The first apartment had generally most of what I required however their were a few minor issues. The window was blocked and the small balcony was not accessible. The shower was e of those mixer types which can be switched to have the water flow through the tap or the shower head. That switch was fully switching so there was water going in both directions hence reducing the pressure of the shower head.
The second apartment was great, it even had an iron and an ironing board.",Low

I had originally booked an apartment for 2 days but needed to stay another night. The apartment I was in had already been booked for the next set of guests so I had to move to another apartment in the block next door. The first apartment had generally most of what I required however their were a few minor issues. The window was blocked and the small balcony was not accessible. The shower was e of those mixer types which can be switched to have the water flow through the tap or the shower head. That switch was fully switching so there was water going in both directions hence reducing the pressure of the shower head.

The host, Esar, was very helpful during our conversations prior to reservation, and after. He helped guide us to the location once I reached Islamabad/Rawalpindi.
The listing was accurately described. It's a very large and expansive property, with two bedrooms, a lounge and kitchen. Two bathrooms.
Heating was an issue but the host had explained this prior to reservation. I would still recommend bringing your own razais/comforters during the winter season; those available at the property are thin and not helpful.
It's a good property to stay with friends or a small family. The drive goes off-road (dirt road) for a short distance when you get close to the property which some may find jarring.
I certainly recommend staying here. Nights will be cold though. Look into that. 👍",Low

Interior of the apartment was cozy with a very comfortable bed. It had nice walking tracks/parks - although parks didn't seem very well maintained. A 24h market was handy to have just infront of the building. I discovered a beautiful mosque also.  An organic farmshop was close by which had fresh fruit/veg, organic meat and fresh smoothies. The highlight was a big  fountain area where I could sit and watch sun set.

We had some issues with the TV and some other which Mahvish always tried to fix as soon as possible. 
It was helpful that she was pretty much available all the time. 
If you are traveling with elders oder kids, the latter one in our case, the location and neighbors can be really noisy. The reception team isn't really helpful and there was construction work going on in the middle of the night.. 
The door is secured with a pin lock. I found that not too safe since the sweeper guy knew the code and was the one who was present when we checked in.
Check in and check out was smooth.
Sometimes Uber and other drivers of other apps wouldn't find the exact location but we would somehow manage. 
Other than that, you have a nice Café right there which offers breakfast, a dry cleaner and some lil supermarkets which have pretty much everything you could require during your stay.",Low

It was helpful that she was pretty much available all the time. 
If you are traveling with elders oder kids, the latter one in our case, the location and neighbors can be really noisy. The reception team isn't really helpful and there was construction work going on in the middle of the night.. 
The door is secured with a pin lock. I found that not too safe since the sweeper guy knew the code and was the one who was present when we checked in.
Check in and check out was smooth.
Sometimes Uber and other drivers of other apps wouldn't find the exact location but we would somehow manage.

The view is amazing from the terrace and from the roof top, especially during this monsoon season for anyone who loves to watch/hear the rain.  The mountain backdrop is beyond idyllic.
The place is very clean and when we got the room service the crew was very thorough. The tv and sound are theater quality. Also, great wifi in case you need to get work done.
Omer is EXCELLENT! We had a smooth check-in and check-out.  Also he was very responsive whenever we had any questions.  Omer checked in with us to make sure everything was going well and to see if we needed anything.  His hospitality and professionalism is extremely impressive.

The view is amazing from the terrace and from the roof top, especially during this monsoon season for anyone who loves to watch/hear the rain.  The mountain backdrop is beyond idyllic.
The place is very clean and when we got the room service the crew was very thorough. The tv and sound are theater quality. Also, great wifi in case you need to get work done.
Omer is EXCELLENT! We had a smooth check-in and check-out.  Also he was very responsive whenever we had any questions.  Omer checked in with us to make sure everything was going well and to see if we needed anything.  His hospitality and professionalism is extremely impressive.

Besides the parking and security were 24/7 available and very accomodative!
One point of attention, since I was for business, is the internet connection. The connection should be stronger so one is able to work from his appartement for business needs.

Visiting Pakistan after a long time, I didn't know what to expect, and had my expectations set fairly low but I must stay that the place was well beyond what I hoped for.
Ausaf and his associates were very responsive, helpful, and kind.
The place is very clean and cozy and, as evident from the pictures, has a very beautiful view of the river from the front window.
One concern that I had, as is usually the case these days anywhere in Pakistan, was the availability of heating and hot water but the host has cleverly worked around these issues with instant electric boilers installed in each of the bathrooms so you have hot water available no matter what time of the day.
Overall my stay was a bang for the buck, I have been trying to think of something negative to say (to sound more legit) but, frankly, don't have anything to point out.
I hope to stay there next time I visit Pakistan.",Low

Later, due to my extenuating circumstances I had to cancel my whole trip. So I never stayed. 
But I must say, that during all this time, Jawad has shown an exceptional professionalism, calm and caring nature throughout our communications. He even helped me finding the resources for my refund from Airbnb. 
Though, I never used Jawad's place for stay but i feel it is needed to say that he is very responsible & execute prompt responses. I am sure, as he possess a professional acumen, his listed apartment must have all the features as listed in his posting.
I would definitely use his place to stay for my next trip.",Low

Place is very neat and clean. It is very well located in the center of city and it was extremely convenient for us to go for shopping and go to airport to catch our flight.
Hosts were very kind and they offered every possible help to make our time better at their place. We had luggage and they were kind to accommodate that in their place and even offered umbrella to our taxi during our checkout since it was raining heavily in Islamabad.
I would highly recommend this place if you are coming for a short family trip and enjoy peaceful Islamabad life.
Thank you and would like to visit you again on our next trip Insha Allah.

Everything was so clean and well maintained. Hot water for bath, clean washroom, airy lower ground portion, clean sheets, breakfast items, Bose home theatre, HD Box, Studio style main hall, Fast Wifi. You name anything and Mr. Shahid has it for the guests.

This was the first time I've experienced such hospitality during my two years of using Airbnb.
I will undoubtedly be returning to this remarkable retreat, and it will always hold a top spot on my list whenever I visit Islamabad. Thank you for an unforgettable stay!",Low

As a foreigner, i am very skeptical of offers that are too good to be true, especially in Pakistan. At least I am.
But here my trust and curiosity more than paid off. Even with 5 stars you can't do justice to this total package. There was nothing that could have been criticized in the slightest. On the contrary, the space would not be enough to highlight the positive things:
-Cleanliness
For me it felt like I was in a 5 star hotel or AirBNB in a major European city.
-Well-being factor
From the first time you enter the apartment you will feel a very familiar and homey feeling which is only enhanced by the warm and open nature of the host over the stay.
-Price/Performance
I can only advise everyone to book this AirBNB and not only because it has an unbeatable price / performance ratio. In the price range up to 150 euros / day you will find nothing that will inspire them so. I will prefer this AIRBNB to any 5 star hotel in ISB",Low

The main building being under construction though, Uber, etc., had difficulty finding it. The love seat was too hard and the gray couch was too soft and too low; it was hard to watch a 3-4 hours of cricket match in any. Also the bright light on the AC disturbed our sleep. Lastly, trash should be emptied daily without the guests having to request the caretaker. And, the decorative bed cover sheet was soiled from previous use, I had complained to the host about it.

Pros:
- Near Market.
- Tower Boy is available for help.
- Security and basic amenities are there.
Cons:
- Bed is very noisy as screws might be lose. Make your sleep harder.
- Apartments are just so close that voice crosses between apartments and there is no sound proofing.
- No heating in bedroom, it depends on lounge AC to heatup your bedroom too.
- Items in Kitchen are missing.

Hot water 24/7, Gas would occasionally lose pressure, but would be back up and running within an hour or two. All of the A/C and Inverters worked perfectly. Pretty safe and secure location with 24/7 Guards all around the premise and inside the building. The walk around balcony was a solid feature along with the epic Islamabad Sunsets.

My parents have been visiting Islamabad regularly for many years and have recently frequented some of the top hotels in the area as well; they both claimed that this was the best place they've stayed in. They loved the house, particularly appreciating the spacious rooms, modern and clean kitchen, excellent crockery and cutlery for dining, and the exceptionally clean linens and towels that were provided. The house itself is in a safe, residential neighborhood but is walking distance to a large grocery store and several outdoor restaurants, which they walked to. It's also a short drive to some of the main attractions in Islamabad so the location was also super convenient. In short, this was one of the best Airbnb experiences possible, and they don't want to stay anywhere else the next time they travel to Islamabad!",Low

He gave clear instructions for reaching his place and getting the keys but there were surely some problems that I faced at his place that made the stay uncomfortable. I’m mentioning them below; some of these he can change to make his place better. 
1. The place is noisy. If people are talking around the apartment, you can EASILY hear it maybe because the apartment is on ground floor. At night it was ESPECIALLY annoying. The constant noise from chaye dhaba (open tea place) next to the apartment made it so hard for me to fall asleep. 
2. The mattresses on beds were either low quality or very old. They sunk in 5 mins after laying on them, making sleep very uncomfortable. 
3. There was strange odour in the apartment. Later realised it might be there because there is open sewage water flowing around that area or heaps of garbage on an empty plot infront of the apartment.
4. Kitchen and bathrooms were not very clean.",Low

It was well furnished and clean when we arrived. You'll be able to get necessities close by. You also get basement parking. The self check-in was easy and quick. There is also plenty of privacy, and Danyal was available at all times.
There is UPS backup, and the Wi-Fi is good. The lounge is also equipped with a smart TV. The apartment was a little smaller than we anticipated, but is comfortable and has many amenities.
However, the walls are thin. The apartment is also located next to a dhaaba, so on Sunday nights there is noise late at night. The surrounding and thin walls might make it not very comfortable for solo female travelers.
All in all, we had a good overall experience at Danyal's place. Danyal is a great host, and was always available with very quick responses. He made sure that we were not inconvenienced, and did his best to resolve any issues that we had. I'd highly recommend staying with such a thoughtful and proactive host!",Low

He gave clear instructions for reaching his place and getting the keys but there were surely some problems that I faced at his place that made the stay uncomfortable. I’m mentioning them below; some of these he can change to make his place better. 
1. The place is noisy. If people are talking around the apartment, you can EASILY hear it maybe because the apartment is on ground floor. At night it was ESPECIALLY annoying. The constant noise from chaye dhaba (open tea place) next to the apartment made it so hard for me to fall asleep. 
2. The mattresses on beds were either low quality or very old. They sunk in 5 mins after laying on them, making sleep very uncomfortable. 
3. There was strange odour in the apartment. Later realised it might be there because there is open sewage water flowing around that area or heaps of garbage on an empty plot infront of the apartment.
4. Kitchen and bathrooms were not very clean.",Low

Initially, communication was problematic as she didn't respond to my app messages for about two hours and chose to contact me through my private phone number. She explained that the previous guests hadn't checked out, complicating check-in due to her remote location.
Her behavior during our interaction seemed unprofessional and her speech hinted at possible intoxication. Consequently, the check-in process was disorganized.
As a health-conscious individual, I planned to cook, but the kitchen, which was supposed to be fully functional, lacked essential items and any means of cooking due to no access to propane.
Additionally, I found used towels and linens on the beds upon arrival. Informing her of the issue yielded no response. This negative experience contrasts starkly with my positive interactions with other hosts in the same building.",Low

Nabeel was nice enough to offer me a different room and  although the new room was very clean and had a good vibe to it because of the modern furniture and decorations - there were some issues with the plumbing in this room as well that made my stay a little less enjoyable. There was a vile smell that would randomly peak through at random times  - even with the exhaust running all the time. I had to turn the fan on and spray my fragrance around me to avoid throwing up because of the horrid smell. The toilet would also make random sounds of water droplets ALL DAY and the toilet flush is weak. It got super annoying so for a few days I even slept on the couch as it was furthest from the bathroom. The light in the washroom also did not work. 5/5 for cleanliness. 3/5 for my overall stay.",Low

We checked in earlier than normal check in time, which was very convenient for us and he was always ready to help. 
However, it is the worst airbnb we have ever stayed.
The apartment is at the basement of the building which means that there is a lot of humidity and of course it smells like a hell (smells from the toilet and kitchen too)
Kitchen 
The wall in the kitchen chip off because of the humidity and falls on the washed dishes and glasses.
In the rusty fridge there was food  in a dish with a used table spoon (from the previous guests? from the caretaker? who knows?). When we told Fauji (the caretaker as Mahmood told us) to throw it away, he said: “Don’t worry! Leave it as it is”! He insisted to keep it in the fridge.
The kitchen is so dirty and filthy that only the cockroaches feel at home!
We made the reservation for 4 people and there were only 2 forks, 2 tea spoons and 2 table spoons. No knives! However there is a lot of cutlery locked in a cupboard at the dining room!
In the garbage bin there was already rubbish! 
There was also a piece of a broken glass at the dish rack.
Of course this situation does not encourage you to make even a cup of coffee! 
There is a machine with a bottle of drinking water (as the water of the tub is not potable) however, all bottles were empty.
Bathroom 
The apartment has two bathrooms, one for each bedroom. 
As I previously said the smell is intolerable.
In one bathroom the flash was out of order.
In the garbage bin of the same bathroom there were used, dirty pampers.
Although it is mentioned in the amenities that there is shampoo, there is not.
There were not hot water, however when we asked they turned the boiler on.
Bedrooms
There was a small issue with the sheets and the towels (not enough) which solved immediately.
The internet too weak, almost dead.
Of course there are photos available for all the above mentioned.
I am also a superhost in Athens, Greece for seven years in a row and I know very well what means to take care of my guests!",Low

The place is within walking distance to the center of the neighborhood, so it's easy to reach shops and restaurants.
However, there is lack of privacy because your place is on front of the shared working station. Your private kitchenette is also where the shared area is, so you don't get the feeling that you're renting an entire unit. There is no gas in you kitchenette, so although I nthe photos it looks as if you could cook your meals there, you can cook meals only on another floor, in a shared kitchen. The list of entities is also too wide: there was no toaster available, nor did I find a mosquito net.
The place is an okay deal for now. However, when I was there, it was still under construction, so maybe in the future, it will improve.",Low
